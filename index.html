        <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
        <p>
          GhostNetBusters is a student-driven project created to raise awareness about ghost nets ‚Äî abandoned fishing gear that continues to trap and kill marine life long after it's been lost. These nets are a huge problem in our oceans, and we wanted to do something practical to highlight the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of our work, we developed an interactive map that helps visualize ghost net locations along the coast and prioritize clean-up efforts based on ecological importance. The tool highlights areas like <strong>kelp forests</strong>, <strong>protected marine zones</strong>, <strong>spawning grounds</strong>, and regions with <strong>red-listed species</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our hope is that this tool can be used to support decision-making and awareness campaigns, and maybe even inspire more people to take action against ghost nets. üåäüêö
