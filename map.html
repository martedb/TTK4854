    <h2>Interactive Map of Ghost Net Locations</h2>
    <p>
      We created this map to give a better overview of where ghost nets have been found along the Norwegian coast. The goal is to make the problem more visible and easier to understand through an interactive experience.
      <br><br>
      You can toggle different <strong>map layers</strong> that highlight areas of ecological importance, such as <strong>protected zones (blue)</strong>, <strong>spawning areas (orange)</strong>, <strong>kelp forests (green)</strong>, and <strong>red-listed species habitats (red)</strong>. While not all of these layers are included yet, the color coding still reflects the structure shown in the info boxes.
      <br><br>
      Ghost nets are marked with <strong>grey circles</strong>. Clicking on a dot gives you more insight into how many nets were found in that spot. The <strong>size of each dot</strong> corresponds to the number of nets at that specific location—larger circles mean more nets. Ghost nets marked in <strong> red</strong> can be found in one of the areas of importance that are shown on the map. 
      <br><br>
      There’s also a <strong>toggleable heatmap</strong> that gives a quick overview of where ghost nets are most concentrated across Norway, making it easier to identify hotspots.
      <br><br>
      This map is part of a student-led project to raise awareness about ghost nets and to highlight how they impact marine ecosystems. We hope it encourages curiosity and maybe even inspires further action.

        <h3>Priority Areas for Ghost Net Removal</h3>

        	<h4>Protected Areas</h4>
        	<p>Protected areas are areas in which human presence is limited due to its natural or cultural values. Norway has more than <strong>3300 </strong>protected areas, with <strong>17.7%</strong> of the mainland and <strong>4.5%</strong> of the sea area being protected. Protected areas can often contain the other types of areas described on this page, having endangered species, spawning areas and ecologically rich environments which could be harmed by the lost nets.

    	<div class="info-box redlist">
        	<h4>Red-list species habitats</h4>
        	<p>The red list is a list that contains habitats and species at risk of extinction or disappearance from a geographical area. Norway’s red list contains almost <strong>5000</strong> species. As there are so few individuals left of these species, the areas in which they reside become more important to protect.

    	<div class="info-box spawning">
        	<h4>Spawning Areas</h4>
        	<p>Spawning areas are where the fish lay their eggs and the new fish hatch. These areas are therefore vital for maintaining a <strong>healthy population of fish</strong>, as newly hatched fish are particularly vulnerable to predation and environmental factors.
Nets in spawning areas will thus be a danger to vulnerable individuals, and furthermore, the presence of decomposing fish in nets may cause spawning fish to avoid these areas, leading them to lay their eggs in less ideal places.

    	<div class="info-box kelp">
        	<h4>Kelp forests</h4>
        	<p>Kelp forests are especially productive ecosystems with a large <strong>diversity of species</strong>. There could be several hundred different species of fish, algae, crustaceans and other marine animals tied to a single forest. Norway especially has a lot of these forests along its long coast, being the country in Europe with the most extensive coverage. 
Kelp forests are however decreasing in size and number, and pollusion is a big part of this problem. They seem to be hot-spots for accumulation of plastics and microplastics.
