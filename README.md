# GhostNetBusters 

This is a project we've been working on to map ghost nets along the Norwegian coast and highlight areas where removal should be prioritized. Itâ€™s a small web-based tool that combines interactive maps with data layers like spawning areas, kelp forests, and protected marine zones.

For the class Experts in teams - Robotic Ocean Waste Removal

## ðŸ”§ What the files do

- **index.html** â€“ The landing page. Just a short intro to what the project is about.
- **map.html** â€“ The page that displays the interactive map generated by `map.py`.
- **map.py** â€“ This script builds the actual map (using Folium) and saves it as an HTML file that gets loaded in `map.html`. It uses:
  - `ghost_nets.csv` for ghost net locations
  - `spawning_ares.geojson` for spawning areas
  - `marine_protected_areas_4326.geojson` for protected zones

- **dup.py** â€“ Cleans the ghost net CSV by removing duplicates. If there are duplicate coordinates, it merges them and adds a "weight" value that shows how often that spot appears.
- **style.css** â€“ Styles for both the homepage and map page.

There are also a few CSV and GeoJSON files in here:
- `ghost_nets.csv`, `nets.csv`, and `nets_org.csv` â€“ ghost net data in different stages (some are raw, some are cleaned).
- `spawning_ares.geojson` â€“ spawning grounds
- `marine_protected_areas_4326.geojson` â€“ protected areas
