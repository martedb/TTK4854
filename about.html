      <h2>What Are Ghost Nets?</h2>
      <p>
        Ghost nets are fishing nets that have been abandoned, lost, or discarded in the ocean. Nearly invisible underwater, these nets continue to trap and kill marine life—including fish, dolphins, turtles, and seabirds—long after being lost. This phenomenon, known as "ghost fishing," poses a major threat to marine ecosystems.

      <h2>Global Impact and Statistics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Between 500,000 and 1 million tons of ghost fishing equipment enter the ocean annually. 
          (<a href="https://earth.org/up-to-a-million-tons-of-ghost-fishing-nets-enter-the-oceans-each-year-study/" target="_blank">Earth.org</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          Ghost nets make up at least 46% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

        </li>
        <li>
          Roughly 2% of all fishing gear is lost annually, including 2,963 km² of gillnets and 25 million traps and pots.

      <h2>Environmental Consequences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In northern Australia, around 80% of marine life entangled in ghost nets are turtles.

        </li>
        <li>
          On the US west coast, an average of 11 large whales were entangled in ghost nets each year from 2000 to 2012. 
          (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_net" target="_blank">Wikipedia: Ghost Net</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          A 2018 study found ghost nets account for ~1% of all marine macroplastics over 200 mm.

      <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Support organizations working to remove ghost nets and reduce plastic pollution.</li>
        <li>Participate in cleanups and report nets to local marine authorities or ghost gear tracking platforms.</li>
        <li>Spread awareness on social media about the dangers of ghost nets and overfishing waste.</li>
